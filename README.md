# Web Chess Arena vs. Computer

## Summary

Web Chess Arena is a sophisticated, client-side web application that offers a compelling chess-playing experience against a formidable AI opponent. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project integrates `chess.js` for robust game logic and move validation, `chessboard.js` for an interactive and visually appealing chessboard interface, and `three.js` for stunning 3D animations. The AI engine is powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, ensuring a challenging and engaging game.

## Setup

To get the application running locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
```
bash
    git clone https://github.com/23f3001304/Web-Chess-Arena-vs-Computer.git
    cd Web-Chess-Arena-vs-Computer
    
```

2.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a static web application, no complex build process is needed. Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Troubleshooting

The application may encounter errors related to Content Delivery Network (CDN) hosted libraries. Common issues include MIME type mismatches, failed Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks, and 404 Not Found errors for scripts.

To resolve these issues, you can take the following steps:

1.  **Update Script URLs**: Ensure that the URLs for external libraries in `index.html` are correct and accessible. For instance, a 404 error on `three.min.js` indicates an incorrect path that needs to be updated.
2.  **Verify Integrity Hashes**: If you encounter SRI-related errors, the `integrity` attribute of the script tag in `index.html` does not match the file's content from the CDN. You can either remove the `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes to bypass this check or update the hash to the correct value for the hosted file version.

## Usage

*   **Making a Move**: Click on a piece to select it, and then click on a valid target square to make a move.
*   **AI Opponent**: The AI will automatically calculate and make its move after you have played.
*   **Game State**: The current game position and move history are displayed for your reference.

## Code Explanation

The application's architecture is modular and straightforward:

*   `index.html`: Defines the structure of the webpage, including the chessboard container and UI elements. It also links to all necessary external libraries and stylesheets.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styling rules for the application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout.
*   `main.js`: The core script of the application, responsible for:
    *   Initializing the chessboard with `chessboard.js`.
    *   Managing game state and move validation using `chess.js`.
    *   Implementing the AI logic, which features the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
    *   Handling user interactions and updating the UI accordingly.

The AI's decision-making process is guided by several advanced heuristics inspired by established chess engine design principles, including:

*   **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization of the minimax algorithm that speeds up the search for the best move by pruning irrelevant branches of the game tree.
*   **Piece-Square Tables**: These tables provide positional evaluations for each piece, encouraging the AI to place its pieces on strategically advantageous squares.
*   **Advanced Evaluation Heuristics**: The AI's evaluation function considers various factors such as material balance, pawn structure, and king safety to make well-informed decisions.
